# USDZ-for-Scientific-Visulisation
Dear user,

Here you can find the USDZ models for visualisation in Augmented Reality. These models based on digital analysis of X-Ray microtomography data obtained for reservoir rocks. The methodology of development .usdz models using open software is described in the article "R.I. Kadyrov. Developing of USDZ models for 3D analysis results visualization in augmented reality".

The models are supported by mobile devices on IOS (12 and higher), MacOS and some Android smartphones (check your device on  https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices).

To open the model please download .usdz files and open on your mobile device.

The author will be thankful for citing the work.

Have a nice experience!
